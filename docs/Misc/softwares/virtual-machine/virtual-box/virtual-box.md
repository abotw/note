You have **clicked the mouse** inside the Virtual Machine display or pressed the **host key**. This will cause the Virtual Machine to **capture** the host mouse pointer (only if the mouse pointer integration is not currently supported by the guest OS) and the keyboard, which will make them unavailable to other applications running on your host machine.

You can press the **host key** at any time to **uncapture** the keyboard and mouse (if it is captured) and return them to normal operation. The currently assigned host key is shown on the status bar at the bottom of the Virtual Machine window, next to the  icon. This icon, together with the mouse icon placed nearby, indicate the current keyboard and mouse capture state.

The host key is currently defined as **Left âŒ˜**.
